Filter created to support a community of startups. For them to kick the bucket of cashew represents to get theis startups out of the box where they're hiding, in this case take them out of the bucket. 

So the idea is to syncronze the moviment of a person kicking the bucket with the animation of the cashews flying in camera's direction.
